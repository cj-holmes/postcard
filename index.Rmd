### About

Hi! I'm Chris Holmes, Data Scientist at [Full Fibre Ltd](https://www.fullfibre.co/) in the South West of England.

I'm a professional, confident and highly driven problem solver with a keen eye for scientific rigour and reproducible analysis.

I have a particular love for the R programming language and enjoy contributing to the R open source community through the development of tools and packages (most often related to data visualisation).

I am also a Nintendo and Columbo enthusiast!
